Sometimes, we need to plan ahead more than one sprint at a time – typically, in conjunction with a fixed-price contract where we have to plan ahead, or else risk signing something that we can’t deliver on time.

> A big problem is that most projects tend to build up to a big-bang release, instead of delivering small increments and measuring to see if they are on the right track. Lean startup, if applied properly, radically reduces the risk and cost of failure

#### Define your acceptance thresholds
Acceptance thresholds: a simple classification of what the importance levels in the product backlog actually mean in terms of the contract.
Here's an example of acceptance thresholds rules:
All items with importance >= 100 must be included in version 1.0, or else we’ll be fined to death.
- All items with importance 50-99 should be included in version 1.0, but we might be able to get away with doing them in a quick follow- up release.
- Items with importance 25-49 are required, but can be done in a follow-up release 1.1.
- Items with importance < 25 are speculative and might never be needed at all.

And here’s an example of a product backlog, color-coded based on the above rules.

So if we deliver everything from banana to onion by the deadline, we’re safe. If time runs short, we might get away with skipping raisin, peanut, donut, or onion. Everything below onion is bonus.
> And you can, of course, do this analysis without having numeric importance ratings! Just order the list. But you got that already.

#### Time-estimate the most important items
In order to do release planning, the product owner needs estimates, at least for all stories that are included in the contract.
A time estimate is valuable if it turns out to be close to correct, less valuable if it turns out to be off by, say, a factor 30%, and completely worthless if it doesn’t have any connection to reality.

Here’s my take on the value of a time estimate in relation to who calculates it and how long time they spend doing it.
![[Time spent doing time estimate.png]]
- Let the team do the estimates and don't make them spend too much time.
- Make sure they understand that the time estimates are crude estimates, not commitments.

The team must make sure that the impact of these meetings on their current sprints is clearly visible to the product owner, so that he understands that their time-estimating work doesn’t come for free.
#### Estimate velocity
OK, so now we have some kind of crude time estimate for the most important stories. Next step is to estimate our average velocity per sprint.

> Skip focus factor. Ask the team to stare at the list and make an educated guess of how far they can get in one sprint. Count up the points. That will be faster than focus factor, and about as accurate/inaccurate. Better to be roughly right than...

#### Put it together into a release plan
Now that we have time estimates and a velocity (45) we can easily chop the product backlog into sprints.
Each sprint includes as many stories as possible without exceeding the estimated velocity of 45. Now we can see that we’ll probably need three sprints to finish all the “must haves” and “should haves”.

We usually add a significant buffer to protect against bad time estimates, unexpected problems, unexpected features, etc. So in this case, we might agree to set the delivery date to three months in the future, giving us one month “reserve”.

#### Adapting the release plan
After each sprint, we look at the actual velocity for that sprint. If the actual velocity was very different from the estimated velocity, we revise the estimated velocity for future sprints and update the release plan. If this puts us into trouble, the product owner may start negotiating with the customer or start checking how he can reduce scope without breaking the contract. Or perhaps he and the team come up with some way to increase velocity or increase focus factor by removing some serious impediment that was identified during the sprint.
Not good news to the customer perhaps, but at least we are being honest and giving the customer an early choice – should we deliver the most important stuff on time or deliver everything late? Usually not a hard choice
