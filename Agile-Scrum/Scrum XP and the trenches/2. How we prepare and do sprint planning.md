#### How we prepare for sprint planning
One lesson we learn over and over is: Make sure the product backlog is in shipshape before the sprint planning meeting.
- The product backlog should exist!
	- There should be one product backlog and one product owner (per product that is)
- All important items should have importance ratings assigned to them, different importance ratings
#### How we do sprint planning
Sprint planning is a critical meeting, probably the most important event in Scrum.
The purpose of the sprint planning meeting is to give the team enough information to be able to work in undisturbed peace for a few weeks, and to give the product owner enough confidence to let them do so.
OK, that was fuzzy. The concrete output of the sprint planning meeting is:
- A sprint goal
- A list of team members (and their commitment levels, if not 100%)
- A sprint blacklog (= a list of stories included in the sprint)
- A defined sprint demo date
- A defined time and place for the daily scrum
#### Why the product owner has to attend
The reason why the whole team and the product owner have to be at the sprint planning meeting is because each story contains three variables that are highly dependent on each other.
Scope and importance are set by the product owner. Estimate is set by the team.
During a sprint planning meeting, these three variable are fine-tuned continuously through face to face dialog between the team and the product owner.

Normally, the product owner starts the meeting by summarizing his goal for the sprint and the most important stories. Next, the team goes through and time-estimates each story, starting with the most important one. As they do this, they will come up with important scope questions
In some cases, the time estimate for a story won’t be what the product owner expected. This may prompt him to change the importance of the story. Or change the scope of the story, which in turn will cause the team to re-estimate, etc., etc.
This type of direct collaboration is fundamental to Scrum and, in fact, all agile software development.

Strongly recommend separating backlog refinement (estimation, story splitting, etc.) into a separate meeting so that sprint planning can be more focused. Product owner participation is still crucial though, in both meetings.

#### Why quality is not negotiable
- External quality is what is perceived by the users of the system. A slow and non-intuitive user interface is an example of poor external quality.
- Internal quality refers to issues that usually aren’t visible to the user, but which have a profound effect on the maintainability of the system. Things like system design consistency, test coverage, code readability, refactoring, etc.
Generally speaking, a system with high internal quality can still have a low external quality. But a system with low internal quality will rarely have a high external quality. It's hard to build something nice on top of a rotten fundament.

 Sacrificing internal quality is almost always a terrible, terrible idea. The time saved is far outweighed by the cost in both short and long terms. Once a code base is permitted to start deteriorating it is very hard to put the quality back in later.
 
> In principle, yes. But in practice I tend to be more pragmatic nowadays. Sometimes it makes perfect business sense to sacrifice quality in the short term – for example, because we have this super-important trade show happening after next sprint or because we just need a prototype to validate a hypothesis about user behavior. But in those cases, the product owner needs to make clear why we are doing this, and to commit to letting the team pay back the technical debt in the near future (sometimes the team will add a “clean up” story to the product backlog, as a reminder). High internal quality should be the norm, and exceptions should be treated as exceptional.

#### Sprint planning meetings that drag on and on...

Everything in Scrum is time-boxed. I love that one, simple, consistent rule. We try to stick to it.
- Do a backlog refinement (I used to call it “backlog grooming” but learned that grooming means Bad Things in some cultures) in a separate meeting. Many teams I’ve seen meet weekly for one hour for backlog refinement, so that sprint planning can be focused on, well, sprint planning! 
- This also gives the product owner more chances to discuss and improve the product backlog before the sprint planning meeting, which in turn makes the meeting shorter.
- Guideline: a sprint planning meeting should normally not take more than one hour per week of sprint length (considerably less for experienced teams), so three hours or less for a three-week sprint.
Learn to keep to your time-boxes, learn to set realistic time-box lengths. That applies both to meeting lengths and sprint lengths.

#### Sprint-planning-meeting agenda
Here’s an example of a typical schedule for us.
Sprint planning meeting: 13:00-17:00 (10-minute break each hour)
- 13:00-13:30 – Product owner goes through sprint goal and summarizes product backlog. Demo place, date, and time is set.
- 13:30-15:00 – Team time-estimates, and breaks down items as necessary. Product owner updates importance ratings as necessary. Items are clarified. “How to demo” is filled in for all high-importance items.
- 15:00-16:00 – Team selects stories to be included in sprint. Do velocity calculations as a reality check.
- 16:00-17:00 – Select time and place for daily scrum (if different from last sprint). Further breakdown of stories into tasks.

#### Defining the sprint length

Short sprints = short feedback cycle = more frequent deliveries = more frequent customer feedback = less time spent running in the wrong direction = learn and improve faster, etc.
But then, long sprints are good too. The team gets more time to build up momentum, they get more room to recover from problems and still make the sprint goal, you get less overhead in terms of sprint planning meetings, demos, etc.
Short enough to give the team adequate corporate agility, long enough for the team to achieve flow and recover from problems that pop up in the sprint.
#### Defining the sprint goal
The important thing is that the goal should be in business terms, not technical terms. This means in terms that people outside the team can understand. 
The sprint goal should answer the fundamental question “Why are we doing this sprint? Why don’t we all just go on vacation instead?” In fact, one way to wheedle a sprint goal out of the product owner is to literally ask that question. The goal should be something that has not already been achieved.
#### Deciding which stories to include in the sprint
One of the main activities of the sprint planning meeting is to decide which stories to include in the sprint. More specifically, which stories from the product backlog to copy to the sprint backlog. The most important story is at the top of the list.
The team decides how many stories to include in the sprint. Not the product owner or anybody else. This raises two questions:
1. How does the team decide which stories to include in the sprint?
2. How can the product owner affect their decision?

#### How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?
Let’s say we have the following situation during a sprint planning meeting.
![[1- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
The product owner is disappointed that story D won’t be included in the sprint. What are his options during the sprint planning meeting?

One option is to reprioritize (in this case bumping out story C)
![[2- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
The second option is to change the scope - reduce the scope of story A until the team believes that story D will fit into the sprint.

![[3- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
The third option is to split a story. The product owner might decide that there are some aspects of story A that really aren't that important, so he splits A into two stories A1 and A2 with different importance levels.
![[4- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
As you see, although the product owner normally can't control the estimated velocity, there are many ways in which he can influence which stories make it into the sprint.

#### How does the team decide which stories to include in the sprint?
We use two techniques for this:
1. Gut feel
2. Velocity calculations
**Estimating using gut feel:**
Gut feel works pretty well for small teams and short sprints.
**Estimate using velocity calculations:**
This technique involves two steps:
1. Decide estimated velocity
2. Calculate how many stories you can add without exceeding estimated velocity
Velocity is a measurement of “amount of work done”, where each item is weighted in terms of its initial estimate.
The picture below shows an example of estimated velocity at the beginning of a sprint and actual velocity at the end of that sprint. Each rectangle is a story, and the number inside is the initial estimate of that story.
![[5- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
One very simple way to estimate velocity is to look at the team’s history. What was their velocity during the past few sprints? Then assume that the velocity will be roughly the same next sprint.
A more sophisticated variant is to do a simple resource calculation. Let’s say we are planning a three-week sprint (15 work days) with a four- person team. Lisa will be on vacation for two days. Dave is only 50% available and will be on vacation for one day. Putting all this together...
...Gives us 50 available man-days for this sprint.
![[6- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
So our estimated velocity will certainly be less than 50. But how much less? We use the term “focus factor” for this.
![[7- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
Focus factor is an estimate of how focused the team is. A low focus factor may mean that the team expects to have many disturbances or expects their own time estimates to be optimistic.
The best way to determine a reasonable focus factor is to look at the last sprint (or even better, average the last few sprints).
![[8- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
Actual velocity is the sum of the initial estimates of all stories that were completed last sprint.
Let’s say last sprint completed 18 story points using a three-person team consisting of Tom, Lisa, and Sam working three weeks for a total of 45 man-days. And now we are trying to figure out our estimated velocity for the upcoming sprint. To complicate things, a new guy, Dave, is joining the team for that sprint. Taking vacations and stuff into account we have 50 man-days next sprint.
![[9- How can product owner affect which stories make it to the sprint?.png]]
So our estimated velocity for the upcoming sprint is 20 story points. That means the team should add stories to the sprint until it adds up to approximately 20.
Whenever possible, look back several sprints and average out the numbers to get more reliable estimates.
The default focus factor I use for new teams is usually 70%, since that is where most of our other teams have ended up over time.
#### Which estimating technique do we use?
I mentioned several techniques above: gut feeling, velocity calculation based on yesterday’s weather, and velocity calculation based on available man-days and estimated focus factor. We usually combine all these techniques to a certain degree. Doesn’t really take long.
We look at focus factor and actual velocity from last sprint. We look at our total resource availability this sprint and estimate a focus factor. We discuss any differences between these two focus factors and make adjustments as necessary.
At the end of the day, the goal is simply to decide which stories to include in the sprint. Focus factor, resource availability, and estimated velocity are just a means to achieve that end.
#### Definition of done
It is very important that the product owner and the team agree on a clear definition of “done”.
If you often run into confusion about the definition of done (which we did in the beginning) you should probably have a “definition of done” field on each individual story.
#### Time estimating using planning poker
Estimating is a team activity – every team member is usually involved in estimating every story:
- At the time of planning, we normally don’t know exactly who will be implementing which parts of which stories.
- Stories normally involve several people and different types of expertise (user-interface design, coding, testing, etc.).
- In order to provide an estimate, a team member needs some kind of understanding of what the story is about. By asking everybody to estimate each item, we make sure that each team member understands what each item is about. This increases the likelihood that team members will help each other out during the sprint. This also increases the likelihood that important questions about the story come up early.
- When asking everybody to estimate a story, we often discover discrepancies where two different team members have wildly different estimates for the same story. That kind of stuff is better to discover and discuss earlier than later.

It is important to remind team members that they are to estimate the total amount of work involved in the story. Not just their part of the work. The tester should not just estimate the amount of testing work.
#### Clarifying stories
The simplest technique is simply to make sure that all the fields are filled in for each story (or more specifically, for each story that has high enough importance to be considered for this sprint).
Some call this “definition of ready”. So “definition of done” is a checklist for when a story is done, and “definition of ready” is a checklist for when a story is ready to be pulled into a sprint. Very useful.
I have found that this simple description often uncovers important misunderstandings about the scope of a story. Good to discover them early, right? 
An alternative is to draw a wireframe sketch or a list of acceptance criteria. Think of the story as a high-level problem statement, and the “definition of done” as a concrete example of how it might look like when done.
#### Breaking down stories into smaller stories
Stories shouldn’t be too small or too big (in terms of estimates). It is almost always possible to break a large story into smaller stories. Just make sure that the smaller stories still represent deliverables with business value.
#### Breaking down stories into tasks
What’s the difference between “tasks” and “stories”:
Stories are deliverable stuff that the product owner cares about. Tasks are non-deliverable stuff, or stuff that the product owner doesn’t care about.
Task breakdown is a great opportunity to identify dependencies – like “we’ll need access to the production logs” or “we’ll need help from Jim in HR” – and figure out ways to deal with those dependencies. Maybe call Jim and see if he can reserve time for us during the sprint. The earlier you discover a dependency, the less likely it is to blow up your sprint!
Note: We practice TDD, which in effect means that the first task for almost each story is “write a failing test” and the last task is “refactor” (= improve code readability and remove duplication).
#### Where to draw the line
**Priority 1:** A sprint goal and demo date. This is the very least you need to start a sprint. The team has a goal, an end date, and they can work right off the product backlog. It sucks, yes, and you should seriously consider scheduling a new sprint planning meeting tomorrow, but if you really need to get the sprint started then this will probably do.
**Priority 2:** List of which stories the team has accepted for this sprint.
**Priority 3:** “Estimate” filled in for each story in sprint.
**Priority 4:** “How to demo” filled in for each story in sprint.
**Priority 5:** Velocity and resource calculations, as a reality check for your sprint plan. Includes list of team members and their commitments (otherwise you can’t calculate velocity).
> Keep it simple and high-level, to take at most five minutes. Ask: “From a staffing perspective, is there anything majorly different about this sprint than past sprints?” If not, use yesterday’s weather. If so, make adjustments accordingly.

**Priority 6:** Stories broken down into tasks. This breakdown can instead be done on a daily basis in conjunction with daily scrums, but will slightly disrupt the flow of the sprint.
#### Tech stories
Referring to stuff that needs to be done but that is not deliverable, not directly related to any specific stories, and not of direct value to the product owner.
For example:
 - Install continuous-build server
 - Write a system design overview
 - Refactor the DAO layer or upgrade Jira
 So here’s what we could do:
 1. Try to avoid tech stories. Look hard for a way to transform a tech story into a normal story with measurable business value. That way the product owner has a better chance to make correct tradeoffs.
 2. If we can’t transform a tech story into a normal story, see if the work could be done as a task within another story. For example, “refactor the DAO layer” could be a task within the story “edit user”, since that involves the DAO layer.
 3. If both of the above fail, define it as a tech story, and keep a separate list of such stories. Let the product owner see it but not edit it. Use the “focus factor” and “estimated velocity” parameters to negotiate with the product owner and bend out some time in the sprint to implement tech stories.

> Smaller tech stories are just embedded into the day-to-day work, while larger stories are written down and placed in a tech backlog, visible to the product owner but managed by the team. The team and product owner agree on a guideline such as “10-20% of our time is spent on tech stories”.

If you can’t have frank conversations with the product owner about things like tech stories, quality, and technical debt, then you have a deeper problem that really needs to be addressed! A symptom of this is if you catch yourself deliberately hiding information from the product owner. You don’t have to involve the product owner in every conversation, but the relationship should really be based on trust and respect; without that, you are unlikely to succeed with whatever you are building.
#### Bug tracking system vs. product backlog
Several strategies:
1. Product owner prints out the most high priority Jira items, brings them to the sprint planning meeting, and puts them up on the wall together with the other stories (thereby implicitly specifying the priority of these items compared to the other stories).
2. Product owner creates stories that refer to Jira items. For example “Fix the most critical back-office reporting bugs: Jira-124, Jira-126, and Jira-180.”
3. Bug fixing is considered to be outside of the sprint, i.e. the team keeps a low enough focus factor (for example 50%) to ensure that they have time to fix bugs. It is then simply assumed that the team will spend a certain amount of time each sprint fixing Jira-reported bugs
4. Put the product backlog in Jira (i.e. ditch Excel). Treat bugs just like any other story.
