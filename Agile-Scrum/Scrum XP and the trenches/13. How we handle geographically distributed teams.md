The ability to pair-program together
- The ability to meet face to face at the daily scrum
- The ability to have face-to-face discussions at any time
- The ability to meet physically and socialize
- The ability to have spontaneous meetings with the whole team
- The ability to see the same view of the sprint backlog, sprint burn down, product backlog, and other information radiators

Distributed teams are everywhere (pun intended). Most open-source projects are built by fully distributed teams, so there’s no doubting that it can be done. Nevertheless, nothing can beat the productivity of a small, cross-functional team sitting together in the same room, 100% focused on a single shared goal. So the first priority should always be to try to achieve that context, or to get as close as possible. If you still can’t avoid having team members in different locations, the tools and techniques listed above are a great way to mitigate the damage. So don’t be stingy, get the best tools money can buy! You’ll never be as productive as a collocated team, but you might get close.
As usual it’s all about experimenting: inspect => adapt => inspect => adapt => inspect => adapt => inspect => adapt => inspect => adapt

#### Offshoring
We have several offshore teams and have been experimenting with how to handle this efficiently using Scrum.

There are two main strategies here: separated teams or separated team members.
The first strategy, separated teams, is a compelling choice. Nevertheless, we have started with the second strategy, separated team members. There are several reasons for this:
1. We want the team members to get to know each other well.
2. We want excellent communication infrastructure between the two locations, and want to give the teams a strong incentive to set this up.
3. In the beginning, the offshore team is too small to form an effective scrum team on their own.
4. We want a period of intense knowledge sharing before independent offshore teams will be a feasible option.

In the long run, we may well move towards the “separated teams” strategy.

> That’s a pretty good overall strategy. In the long term, you really want collocated teams, because a distributed team just won’t achieve the same “teaminess”. So even if you initially have a distributed team, keep looking for ways to create separate, distinct teams at each location. You’ll still need to handle dependencies and communication issues between the two teams, but that’s an easier problem to deal with. In addition to the improved day-to-day communication, one of the main wins is motivation. Having your teammates in the same room is fun! And motivated people build better stuff, faster.

#### Team members working from home
Basically, we leave it to the teams to decide when and how often it is OK to work from home. Some team members work from home regularly due to long commutes. We do, however, encourage the teams to be physically collocated “most” of the time.

We once tried the concept of having Wednesdays designated as focus day. That basically meant “if you would like to work from home, that’s fine, but do it on Wednesdays. And check with your team.” This worked pretty well with the team that we tried it on. Usually, most of the team stayed home on Wednesdays and they get a lot done, while still collaborating fairly well. Since it only was one day, the team members didn’t get too out of sync with each other. For some reason, this never quite caught on with the other teams though.

> One of the key ideas in Scrum is the self-organizing team. The importance of this can’t be overstated. The team should be given as much responsibility as possible, including things like work hours and work- from-home policies. Self-organization is the key to creativity, motivation, innovation, and many other Good Things! Some managers are afraid that teams will misuse this trust, but I rarely see that happen in practice. As long as the team is clearly accountable for the product they deliver, they tend to act responsibly.
