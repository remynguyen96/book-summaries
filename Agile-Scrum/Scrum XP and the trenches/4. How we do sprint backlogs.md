#### Sprint-backlog format
We’ve experimented with different formats for the sprint backlog, including Jira, Excel, and a physical task board on the wall.

This chart shows that:
- On first day of the sprint, August 1, the team estimated that there were approximately 70 story points of work left to do. This was in effect the estimated velocity of the whole sprint.
- On August 16, the team estimates that there were approximately 15 story points of work left to do. The dashed trend line shows that they are approximately on track, i.e. at this pace they will complete everything by the end of the sprint.
We skip weekends on the X-axis since work is rarely done on weekends. We used to include weekends but this would make the burn down slightly confusing, since it would “flatten out” over weekends, which would look like a warning sign.
#### Task-board warning signs
A quick glance at the task board should give anyone an indication of how well the sprint is progressing. The Scrum master is responsible for making sure that the team acts upon warning signs such as:

#### What about traceability?
If traceability is very important to you, then perhaps the task-board solution is not for you.
I still find traceability hugely overrated. Add some simple conventions such as writing the story ID in your commit comment, and you get more than enough traceability for most contexts.
#### Estimating days vs. hours
In most books and articles on Scrum, you’ll find that tasks are time- estimated in hours, not days. We used to do that. Our general formula was: 1 effective man-day = 6 effective man-hours.
So now we use man-days as a basis for all time estimates (although we call it story points). Our lowest value is 0.5, i.e. any task that is smaller than 0.5 is either removed, combined with some other task, or just left with a 0.5 estimate (no great harm in overestimating slightly)

> Even simpler: skip estimating tasks entirely! Most teams eventually learn how to break their work into tasks that are roughly a day for one to two people. If you can do that, you don’t need to bother with task estimates, which eliminates a lot of waste. Burn-down charts can still be used (if you must) – in that case, just count the tasks instead of adding up the hours.

#### Keep the managers and coaches at bay

Good managers are a crucial success factor, but as manager, you should try to make yourself redundant. You probably won’t succeed with that, but the very act of trying will push you in the right direction. Ask “What does this team need in order to manage itself?” rather than “How can I manage this team?” They need things like transparency, clear purpose, a fun and motivating work environment, air cover, and an escalation path for impediments.
