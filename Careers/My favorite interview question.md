##### Getting stuck
Sometimes the scope of this question is too big for people to grasp and they get stuck. The enormity of defining any job they want can be overwhelming to certain people, and if that happens, I ask some followup questions to send them down the right path:
- Let’s start very simple: do you want to be writing code all day? If not, what else would you like to be doing?
- Would you be working alone or on a team? If on a team, what role would you play on that team?
- Is there a programming language you’d like to be spending most of your time in? What percentage of time would you need in that programming language to be happy?
- Let’s turn this around: what would you absolutely not want to do?
- Is there something you’d like to spend time learning on your new job?

These questions are designed to get the candidate back on track (I never let people opt-out of the question). By helping to narrow down the job description to a few options, most candidates are able to continue down this path once they start.

##### Leader vs. follower
Here’s the tricky part: leaders are more likely to tell you they feel they can and followers will almost never tell you they prefer to follow. Of course, you also can’t really ask them directly because no one wants to be thought of as a follower so everyone will say they are a leader. I’ve found it best to just listen to what people say and make a determination. The key phrases I look for in determining if someone is a leader are:
- I like to help other people
- I feel like I have a lot of experience to share
- I don’t mind/I love mentoring others

By the way, if you’re thinking you can trick someone into think you’re a leader by using these phrases, you’re wrong. They are just indicators to dig deeper, you’re not going to trick someone who knows what they’re doing.

**Important:** Both leaders and followers are important for a healthy team. Equally important is making sure you match people with the correct roles. Putting a follower into a leadership position is incredibly damaging to everyone, likewise forcing a leader into a follower position will lead to unhappiness. The goal here isn’t to weed out followers, it’s to make sure you’re matching people to positions effectively.

##### Time spent
At some point during the discussion I usually ask people to break down how much of their time they’d like to spend on any particular task. Do they want a 50/50 split between coding work and management work? Do they want to spend 70% of their time designing and architecting and only 30% doing actual coding? Are they a manager who wants to spend 10% of their time coding to “stay in the game?” These are all important to understand to get a full understanding of the person.
