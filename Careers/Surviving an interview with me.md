##### Answer the question
I’ve sat in too many interviews where I ask questions and the candidate talks around the topic but never actually answers the question. But seriously, come back to the point. If you’re not sure what I’m asking for, ask me to clarify, I have no problem repeating questions or trying to ask them in a different way
##### Tell me what you don't know
If I ask you something that’s out of your realm of knowledge, say so. I don’t expect you to be an encyclopedia. Once I know that you don’t know how to answer, I can more fairly evaluate you. You won’t get to avoid the question, but I’ll give you hints to see if your problem-solving skills can take you the rest of the way.
##### Don't give up
 I’m giving you hints to get the correct answer; don’t stop me every step and say, “I really don’t know.” In our profession, you’ll be met with challenges that you don’t have an immediate solution for, will you give up then? I need to know you’re able to work through a problem and don’t get so frustrated that you just throw in the towel.
##### Don’t assume trick questions
All of my questions have answers, most of them have many different correct answers, and I promise that I will never ask you a trick question. It demeans you and it’s useless to me. Assume each question I ask has at least one correct answer.
##### Back up your statements
If you say something hinting at a solution or some knowledge you have, be prepared to discuss it. If I ask you a question and you say something like, “well, since IE doesn’t support CSS3…”, then you better be prepared to tell me what you’d do if IE did support CSS3.

##### Don’t say you’re an expert
This probably goes for most interviews, but especially with me. I never ask you to rank your skills on a scale of 1 to 10, so don’t offer that information to me. As soon as you put yourself into the “expert” category, I’m going to start you off with tougher questions. I’ve yet to meet someone who introduced themselves as an expert who actually was. Experts don’t need to tell you that they’re experts, they show you.
##### Don't try to impress me
If I want to know something, I’ll ask. I know the information I need to get while in the interview, and any time I hear someone say, “want to see a neat trick?” or something of the same flavor, I start to tune out. Just answer what I ask as best you can.
##### Be enthusiastic
Show a willingness and eagerness to learn. Be able to talk about the product, the company, why this is the job you want. And pay close attention on that last one, I don’t want to hear about all the reasons your current job sucks. It’s certainly okay to explain the opportunities that you haven’t received in your current or past position, but present it as how you’re looking forward to growing and why this is the best place for you to do that.
