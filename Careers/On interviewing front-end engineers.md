Front-end engineers are, of course, specialists. We care about things that seem insane to others: understanding differences between dozens of browsers, pixels vs. ems, PNG vs. JPEG, compatibility of JavaScript APIs, how to construct a DOM to represent a UI, and so on. When I try to explain something cool I did to a back-end engineer, their eyes tend to glaze over very quickly

In general, I believe interviews should be designed to demonstrate skills that a candidate will be expected to use on a day-to-day basis.
 
I did this not by focusing on trivia and things that they wouldn’t actually end up doing on a daily basis; I did it by creating questions that showed me they would be able to take on the tasks I had waiting for them upon arrival. Getting to know people within their problem space is important.
