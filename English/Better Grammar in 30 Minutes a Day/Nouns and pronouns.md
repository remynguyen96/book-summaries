### Key Takeaways

Use a **singular noun** when you are referring to only one person, place, thing, idea, or activity, and a **plural noun** when you are referring to more than one.

These words indicate that a singular word usually follows:
`one / each / every / a / an / a single`

Most nouns form the plural by adding the letter **s**.
`bed, beds    pen, pens    pipe, pipes`

Words that end in y, preceded by a consonant, form the plural by changing the **y** to **i** and adding **es**.
`country, countries      battery, batteries`

Words that end in **sh, s, ch, x and z** form the plural by adding **es**.
`wish, wishes     buzz, buzzes`

Nouns the end in **f, ff or fe** usually add **s**. Certain nouns change the ending to **ve** and then add **s.**
`knife, knives     thief, thieves`

Most nouns ending in **o** form the plural by adding **s**. Here are fix commonly used words, however, that are exceptions: echo, hero, potato, tomato, torpedo, and veto. To these words, add **es**.
`echo - echoes     hero, heros      potato, potatoes`

Some nouns do not add **s** or **es** to form the plural. These nouns change their spelling.
`woman, women      foot, feet       tooth, teeth`
`goose, geese     child, children   mouse, mice`

These words indicate that a plural word usually follows:
`all, a lot of (the), each of (the), many, both, several, one of (the), some, few, most, two (or more)`

#### Possessives

In addition to nouns changing their forms to indicate the plural, nouns can change their forms to show ownership or a belonging-to relationship. To signal this relationship, we change the form of the noun by adding an apostrophe and the letter **s** or in some cases just the apostrophe.

1. Add an apostrophe and an s to words that do not end in **s**.
`the girl's scarf,    the men's coats` `
2. Add _only_ an apostrophe to words that end in **s**.
`the girls' scarves,   the monkeys' tails`
3.  Add an apostrophe and an **s** to the final word in a compound noun.
`my father-in-law's business, somebody else's mistake`
4. Add an apostrophe and an **s** to the second noun when two nouns are used to show common ownership.
`John and Gina's mother`
5. Generally the possessive form is not used with nonliving things.
`The table leg, the magazine cover`

Pronouns do not add **s** or **es** to form the plural.

**Singular forms** are used to refer to **one person**, thing, or idea.
`I live in an apartment`

**Plural forms** are used to refer to **more than one** person, thing, or idea.
`Three of you are tied for first place`

The long form of the possessive pronoun replaces the noun. completely. We use the long form when the sentence follows another in which the noun is clearly stated.
`I washed my car. You didn’t wash yours.`

In these sentences, the reader should have no trouble understanding that **yours** replaces **your car** since the noun car is stated in the previous sentence.
`Your notebook is here on the desk. Mine is in the car`

Pronouns that end in **-self** and **-selves** are called **reflexive** pronouns.
The reflexive pronoun is used in two ways:
`I cut myself` -> a **myself** is used to refer back to **I**.
`The president himself shook my father’s hand.` -> **himself** is used to emphasize the person named, the president.
