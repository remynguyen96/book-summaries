## Key Takeaways

The **subject** of a sentence is the person or the thing the **verb** is asking or telling about. The subject may be a **noun** or a **pronoun.** Every sentence must have at least one subject and one verb and express a complete thought.

Each sentence must have at least one subject and one verb, but the verb can stand alone in a sentence without a stated subject in a **command** or **request.**
###### Prepositional Phrases
- **prepositional phrase** is often used to expand the subject and the verb.
- We usually add words to the subject and the verb to give more information about them. Sometimes we use one word, sometimes a group of words
- Prepositions are the short words that show position, relationship, or direction.
`The pencil is on the desk`

Each prepositional phrase contains at least two words: a **preposition** and **an object**. The object is always a noun or a pronoun.
`Lloyd enjoys a glass of root beer`
Some prepositional phrases contain adjectives that come between the preposition and the object. These words describe the object.
`Lloyd enjoys a glass of cool, foamy beer`

**_Commonly Used Prepositions_**

| Position | Direction | Relationship |
| -------- | --------- | ------------ |
| about    | at        | as           |
| above    | beyond    | because of   |
| across   | down      | but          |
| after    | from      | by           |
| against  | in        | except       |
| along    | into      | for          |
| before   | on        | like         |
| during   | to        | of           |
| near     | toward    | since        |
| until    | up        | with         |

One common mistake in identifying the subject of a sentence is confusing it with a noun used as the object of the preposition. Any word that is part of the prepositional phrase _cannot_ be the subject of the sentence.

These prepositions are made up of two or more words as in the sentence:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|according to|in addition to|in spite of|
|along with|in case of|on account of|
|because of|in front of|on top of|
|by means of|in the middle of|out of|
|contrary to|in place of|together with|
|for the sake of|instead of|with reference to|
