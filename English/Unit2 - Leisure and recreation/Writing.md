The bar chart displays the number of men and women participated in the Olympics during the period from 1924 to 2012. Whilst the line graph illustrates the total of participants who have joined since the Olympics began in 1924. Overall, it can be seen that there was an upward trend in the number of athletes regardless of gender from 1924 to 2012.

Looking at the bar chart, it is readily apparent that there are always more male players than females throughout the entire period. In addition, there has been a significant increase in the participation of females, whereas the quantity of male participants rose slightly. The number of women participated in 1924 was approximately 100 players. Subsequently, It continued to increase gradually but more dramatically to approximately 5,000 players in 2012. 

Turning to the line graph, there was a similar trend, with the total of participants rising throughout the period. From 1924 to 1984, the sum of players remained relatively stable, with a slight upward trend. However, starting in 1984, there was a significant acceleration in participants growth.

To summarise therefore, the number of athletes participating in the Olympics has increased since 1924. As was the case of women, the highest number of participants was nearly the same as men in 2012.
