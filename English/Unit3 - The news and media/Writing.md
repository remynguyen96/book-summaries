### Steps to complete a process diagram task:

1. Read the question and the process diagram and underline key words. Paraphrase key words where possible.
2. Look for a logical start point for the process.
3. Number steps in the process to make sure you will not miss out any of the steps when you write your report. Make sure you don't forget the last step!
4. Work out the overall summary. This will usually be the total number of steps in the process. Other options might be the number of pieces of equipment or the number of different materials used in the process.
5. Plan the structure of answer (how can the data be grouped). Try to look for a middle point in the process. This way you can separate the steps of the process into two paragraphs.
6. Write the report.
7. Proofread the report.

The flow-chart illustrates how newspapers are printed via a method called the lithography process. Overall, there are six different stages in the procedure, beginning with inserting paper into the system and ending with printed image.

Looking at the first stages of the process, we can see that paper has been inserted and gone through dampening rollers which provide a mixture of water and chemistry in a tray. Afterwards, in order to get colours for images, the paper continuously has been passed through the ink rollers. Then, it is rolled down to these distinctive cylinders. At this stage, the water can be squeezed out by the blanket cylinders. In the next stages, the paper runs between the blanket cylinder and the impression cylinder respectively, pressing the image onto the paper. Finally, the paper undergoes a heating and cooling process which makes it is dried with hot and cold air before becoming printed images.
