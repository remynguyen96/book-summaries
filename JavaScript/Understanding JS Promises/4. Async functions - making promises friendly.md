Async functions are enabled by default in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, and they're quite frankly marvelous. They allow you to write promise-based code as if it were synchronous, but without blocking the main thread. They make your asynchronous code less "clever" and more readable.

```js
async function myFirstAsyncFunction() {  
	try {  
		const fulfilledValue = await promise;  
	} catch (rejectedValue) {  
		// â€¦  
	}  
}
```

Async functionsÂ _always_Â return a promise, whether you useÂ `await`Â or not. That promise resolves with whatever the async function returns, or rejects with whatever the async function throws.

```js
// Careful! Avoid going too sequential
async function series() {  
	await wait(500); // Wait 500msâ€¦  
	await wait(500); // â€¦then wait another 500ms.  
	return 'done!';  
}

// The above takes 1000ms to complete, whereas:
async function parallel() {  
	const wait1 = wait(500); // Start a 500ms timer asynchronouslyâ€¦  
	const wait2 = wait(500); // â€¦meaning this timer happens in parallel.  
	await Promise.all([wait1, wait2]); // Wait for both timers in parallel.  
	return 'done!';  
}
```

```js
// Not recommended - too sequential ðŸš«
async function logInOrder(urls) {  
	for (const url of urls) {  
		const response = await fetch(url);  
		console.log(await response.text());  
	}  
}

// Recommended - nice and parallel âœ…
function markHandled(...promises) {  
	Promise.allSettled(promises);  
}  
  
async function logInOrder(urls) {  
	// fetch all the URLs in parallel  
	const textPromises = urls.map(async (url) => {  
		const response = await fetch(url);  
		return response.text();  
	});  
	  
	markHandled(...textPromises);  
	  
	// log them in sequence  
	for (const textPromise of textPromises) {  
		console.log(await textPromise);  
	}  
}

/* 
TheÂ `for`Â loop in the previous example could make use of another JavaScript feature [for awaitâ€¦of](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of).

for await (const text of textPromises) { 
	console.log(await text); 
}

 This automaticallyÂ `await`s the next item in the iterable (theÂ `textPromises`Â array in this case).
 It awaits at the start of each turn through the loop, so the performance is the same asÂ `await`ing within the loop.
