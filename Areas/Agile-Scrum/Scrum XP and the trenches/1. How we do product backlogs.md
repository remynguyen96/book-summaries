The product backlog is the heart of Scrum. A good product starts with a customer need and a vision for how to solve it. The product backlog is basically a prioritized list of requirements, or stories, or features, or whatevers. Things that the customer wants, described using the customer’s terminology.
We call these **stories**, or sometimes just **backlog items**. And include the following fields:
- **ID**: Avoid losing track of stories when we rename
- **Name**: A short, descriptive name of the story
- **Importance**: The product owner's importance rating for this story
- **Initial estimate**: The team's initial assessment of how much work is needed to implement this story compared to other stories.
- **How to demo**: A high-level description of how this story will be demonstrated at the sprint demo. "*Do this, then do that, then this should happen.*"
- **Notes**:  Any other info, clarifications, references to other sources of info, etc. Normally very brief.

We experimented with lots of other fields, but at the end of the day, the six fields above were the only ones that we actually used sprint after sprint.
#### How we keep the product backlog at a business level
The team is normally better suited to figure out how to solve something, so the product owner should focus on business goals.

When I see technically oriented stories like this, I normally ask the product owner a series of “but why?” questions until we find the underlying goal. Then we rephrase the story in terms of the underlying goal (“speed up the search event form in the back office”). The original technical description ends up as a note (“Indexing the event table might solve this”).

> There’s an old and well-established template for this: “**As X, I want Y, so that Z**.”
> For example “As buyer, I want to save my shopping cart, so that I can continue shopping tomorrow.” I’m really surprised I hadn’t heard of that in 2007! Would have been very convenient. Yes, there are more elaborate templates available nowadays, but this simple one is a good starting point, especially for teams that are new to the whole agile thing. The template forces you to ask the right types of questions, and reduces the risk of getting stuck in techy details.
