A lot of things get much harder when you have multiple Scrum teams working on the same product. That problem is universal and doesn’t really have anything to do with Scrum. More developers = more complications.

The key questions are:
1. How many teams to create?
2. How to allocate people into teams?

>  And of course, how to keep the teams in sync with each other.
#### How many teams to create?
If dealing with multiple Scrum teams is so hard, why do we bother? Why not just put everyone in the same team?
The biggest single Scrum team we’ve had was around 11 people. It worked, but not too well. Daily scrums tended to drag on past 15 minutes. Team members didn’t know what other team members were doing, so there would be confusion. It was difficult for the Scrum master to keep everyone aligned towards the goal, and difficult to find time to address all obstacles that were reported.
The alternative is to split into two teams. But is that better? Not necessarily.
If the team is experienced and comfortable with Scrum, and there is a logical way of splitting the roadmap into two distinct tracks, and those two tracks don’t both involve the same source code, then I’d say it’s a good idea to split the team. Otherwise, I’d consider sticking to one team, despite the disadvantage of big teams. My experience is that it is better to have fewer teams that are too big than to have many small teams that keep interfering with each other. Make small teams only when they don’t need to interfere with each other!
#### Virtual teams
How do you know if you made the right or wrong decision with respect to the “big team” vs. “many teams” tradeoff?
If you keep your eyes and ears open, you may notice that “virtual teams” form.

**Example 1:** You choose to have one large team. But when you start looking at who talks to whom during the sprint, you notice that the team has effectively split into two sub-teams.
![Virtual_teams_1.png](Virtual_teams_1.png)

Look at example 1 again. If the two virtual sub-teams tend to change once in a while (i.e. people move between the virtual sub-teams) then you probably made the right decision to have them as a single Scrum team. If the two virtual sub-teams stay the same throughout the whole sprint, you probably want to break them apart into two real Scrum teams next sprint.

**Example 2**: You choose to have three smaller teams. But when you start looking at who talks to whom during the sprint, you notice that team 1 and team 2 are talking to each other all the time, while team 3 is working in isolation.

![Virtual_teams_2.png](Virtual_teams_2.png)
Now look at example 2 again. If members of team 1 and team 2 (but not team 3) are talking to each other throughout the whole sprint, you probably want to combine team 1 and team 2 into a single Scrum team next sprint. If team 1 and team 2 are talking to each other a lot throughout the first half of the sprint, and then team 1 and team 3 talk to each other throughout the second half of the sprint, then you should consider combining all three teams into one, or just leaving them as three teams. Bring up the question during the sprint retrospective and let the teams decide for themselves.

Team division is one of the really hard parts of Scrum. Don’t think too deeply or optimize too hard. Experiment, keep watch for virtual teams, and make sure you take plenty of time to discuss this type of stuff during your retrospectives. Sooner or later, you will find the right solution for your particular situation. The important thing is that the teams are comfortable and don’t stumble over each other too often.

> One increasingly popular advanced technique is to let teams dynamically reform themselves as needed. I sometimes call this the “super-team” pattern or “dynamic sub-teams”. It works best when you have 12-16 people that sit close, know each other well, and work on the same product. Give them a single shared product backlog, and have people form small clusters around individual stories (“Pat and Tom and I will work on story X now”), and regroup dynamically as stories get done. Some facilitation is needed to make this work in practice, but it’s perfect for the case when you don’t want one single big team, and yet can’t find a consistent way to break them into smaller teams.

#### Optimal team size
I have noticed that sometimes a big team moves faster when some members are on vacation. But it’s usually not because the missing people were weak team members. It’s just that the team size became more manageable, and the communication and confusion overhead was reduced.

Let’s say you have two different products, with one three-person team per product, and both are moving too slow. It might be a good idea to combine them into one single six-person team responsible for both products. In that case let one of the two product owners go (or give him an advisory role or something).
![Optimal_team_size.png](Optimal_team_size.png)
Let’s say you have a single 12-person Scrum team, because the codebase is in such a crappy state that there is no way for two different teams to work on it independently. Put some serious effort into fixing the codebase (instead of building new features) until you get to a point where you can split the team. This investment will probably pay off quite quickly.

> This is worth emphasizing. If you struggle with finding the right team structure, the real culprit is often the system architecture. A good architecture lets teams move fast and independently, a bad architecture causes teams to stumble over each other and get bogged down by dependencies. So you should continuously question and evolve both your architecture and your team structure.

#### Synchronized sprints – or not?

Let’s say you have three Scrum teams working on the same product. Should their sprints be synchronized, i.e. start and end together? Or should they overlap?
Our first approach was to have overlapping sprints (with respect to time).

![Synchronized_sprints_1.png](Synchronized_sprints_1.png)
This sounded nice. At any given moment in time, there would be an ongoing sprint just about to end and a new sprint just about to begin. The product owner’s workload would be evenly spread out over time. There would be releases flowing continuously out of the system. Demos every week.
We had just started doing this when I one day had the opportunity to talk to Ken Schwaber. He pointed out that this was a bad idea, that it would be much better to synchronize the sprints. I don’t remember his exact reasons, but after some discussion I was convinced.
![Synchronized_sprints_2.png](Synchronized_sprints_2.png)
- There is a natural time at which to rearrange teams – between sprints! With overlapping sprints, there is no way to rearrange teams without disturbing at least one team in mid-sprint.
- All teams could work towards the same goal in a sprint and do sprint planning meetings together, which leads to better collaboration between teams.
- Less administrative overhead, i.e. fewer sprint planning meetings, sprint demos, and releases.

> At Spotify, we used to have synchronized sprints, until we decided to let each team work at its own pace and choose its own sprint length (some do kanban instead of sprints). When we have a lot of dependencies between teams, we do a daily scrum-of-scrums type of sync meeting and a weekly demo of the integrated product, regardless of which rhythm each individual team has. Can’t say which pattern is best, though – it’s contextual.

#### Why we introduced a “team lead” role
Let’s say we have a single product with three teams.
![Why_we_introduced_a_team-lead_role.png](Why_we_introduced_a_team-lead_role.png)The red guy labeled P is the product owner. The black guys labeled S are Scrum masters. The rest are grunts... – er, respectable team members.

With this constellation, who decides which people should be in which teams? The product owner? The three Scrum masters together? Or does every person get to select his own team? But then what if everyone wants to be in team 1 (because Scrum master 1 is so good looking)?

What if it later turns out that it is really not possible to have more than two teams working in parallel on this codebase, so we need to transform this into two nine-person teams instead of three six-person teams. That means two Scrum masters. So which one of the current three Scrum masters will be relieved of his title?

In many companies, these will be quite sensitive issues.

It is tempting to let the product owner do the allocation and reassignment of people. But that isn’t really product-owner stuff, right? The product owner is the domain expert who tells the team in which direction they should run. He should not really have to get involved in the nitty-gritty details.

We’ve solved this by introducing a “team lead” role. This corresponds to what you might call “scrum-of-scrums master” or “the boss” or “main Scrum master” etc. He doesn’t have to lead any single team, but he is responsible for cross-team issues such as who should be Scrum master for teams, how people should be divided into teams, etc.
We had a hard time coming up with a good name for this role. “Team lead” was the least lousy name we could find.

> In most other companies I’ve seen, the line manager is responsible for team structure, and there’s no need for a team-lead role (besides, “team lead” is a rather confusing name, as it sounds like there’s only one team). However, the best managers find a way to help the team self-organize into a suitable structure rather than assign a structure top-down.

#### How we allocate people to teams

There are two general strategies for allocating people to teams, when you have multiple teams on the same product:
Let a designated person do the allocation, for example the “team lead” that I mentioned above, the product owner, or the functional manager (if he is involved enough to be able to make good decisions here).
Let the teams do it themselves somehow.
We’ve experimented with all three. Three? Yeah. Strategy 1, Strategy 2, and a combination of both. We found that the combination of both works best.

Before the sprint planning meeting, the team lead calls for a team- allocation meeting together with the product owner and all Scrum masters. We talk about last sprint and decide if any team reallocations are warranted. Perhaps we want to combine two teams, or move some people from one team to another. We decide on something and write it down as a proposed team allocation, which we bring to the sprint planning meeting.

The first thing we do during the sprint planning meeting is go through the top-priority items in the product backlog. The team lead then says something like “Hi, everyone. We suggest the following team allocation for next sprint.

“As you see, this would mean a reduction from four to three teams. We have listed members for each team. Please group up and grab yourself a wall section.”

![allocate_people_to_teams.png](allocate_people_to_teams.png)
“Now, this team division is preliminary! It is just a starting point, to save time. As the sprint planning meeting progresses, you are free to wander off to another team instead, split your team into two, combine with another team, or whatever. Use common sense based on the product owner’s priorities.”

> It’s a great pattern. Just keep in mind that there’s lots of different ways this can be done – combining it with sprint planning is just one way, and not always the best. Nowadays, I usually run reorganization workshops separately from sprint planning, to keep the sprint planning meetings more focused (as in, we have a stable team structure and stable product backlog when planning the sprint). For large projects, however, it’s useful to do all sprint planning meetings simultaneously in a big room. Sometimes a gnarly dependency can be resolved simply by someone switching teams (temporarily or long-term).

#### Specialized teams – or not?
Let’s say your technology consists of three main components:
![Specialized_teams_or_not_1.png](Specialized_teams_or_not_1.png)
And let’s say you have 15 people working on this product, so you really don’t want to run them as a single Scrum team. What teams do you create?

Approach 1: Component-specialized teams
One approach is to create component-specialized teams such as a client team, a server team, and a DB team.
![Specialized_teams_or_not_2.png](Specialized_teams_or_not_2.png)

This is where we started. Doesn’t work too well, at least not when most stories involve multiple components. For example, let’s say we have a story named “Notice-board where users can post messages to each other”. This notice-board feature would involve updating the user interface in the client, adding logic to the server, and adding some tables in the database.
![Specialized_teams_or_not_3.png](Specialized_teams_or_not_3.png)
This means all three teams - the client team, the server team, and the DB team - have to collaborate to get this story done. Not too good.

> A surprisingly common problem in many companies!

#### Approach 2: Cross-component teams
A second approach is to create cross-component teams, i.e. teams that are not tied to any specific component.
If many of your stories involve multiple components, this type of division strategy will work better. Each team can implement a whole story including the client parts, server parts, and DB parts. The teams can thereby work more independently of each other, which is a Good Thing.

One of the first things we did when introducing Scrum was to break up the existing component-specialized teams (approach 1) and create cross- component teams instead (approach 2). This lessened the number of cases of “we can’t complete this item because we are waiting for the server guys to do their part.”

![Specialized_teams_or_not_4.png](Specialized_teams_or_not_4.png)

> Same story with almost every company I’ve worked with. Reorganizing from component teams to feature teams can be quite disruptive, but the benefits are huge!

Sometimes, component teams do make sense, even for the long term. But it should be the exception, not the norm. A good test question for a team is “who is our customer, and can we fulfill their needs without having to block on other teams?” In most cases, a feature team will pass that test and a component team won’t. The most common exception is internal-facing teams such as tools and platform teams (e.g. a server-infrastructure team). They should treat the other teams (the feature teams) as their customers in a very literal sense. Larger companies usually end up with a mix of outward-facing feature teams and inward-facing component teams. There’s no silver bullet though, so just keep experimenting!

#### Rearrange teams between sprints – or not?

> Rule of thumb: After a few sprints, your team structure should be fairly stable. That is, for any given team, their membership is unchanged (no people added or removed) for at least a quarter. If the team changes more often than that, they’ll probably never reach the hyper-productive state that Scrum aims for. However, changes that come from within (initiated by team members) are usually less disruptive than team changes imposed from above. So if you are a manager, try hard to resist the temptation to meddle. Let people focus, encourage team stability, but also allow people to switch teams whenever they see a need. You will probably be amazed by the results!

#### Part-time team members

> Rule of thumb: Full time means at least 90% dedicated to this team. Part time means 50-90% (“This is my home team but I have other commitments, too”). Less than 50% means not a team member (“I can support you guys from time to time, but I’m not part of your team and you can’t always count on me”). If a team has only one part-timer and the rest full-time, then don’t worry about it. If they have more than one part- timer, however, then you should consider reorganizing or reduce the total amount of work in progress so that some part-timers can become full-timers. Multitasking is a beast that kills productivity, motivation, and quality, so keep it at an absolute minimum!

#### How we do scrum-of-scrums
Scrum-of-scrums is basically a regular meeting where all Scrum masters gather to talk.

At one point in time, we had four products, where three of the products only had one Scrum team each, and the last product had 25 people divided into several Scrum teams. Something like this:

![scrum-of-scrums.png](scrum-of-scrums.png)

This means we had two levels of scrum-of-scrums. We had one product- level scrum-of-scrums consisting of all teams within Product D, and one corporate-level scrum-of-scrums consisting of all products.

#### Product-level scrum-of-scrums
This meeting was very important. We did it once per week, sometimes more often than that. We discussed integration issues, team-balancing issues, preparations for the next sprint planning meeting, etc. We allocated 30 minutes but frequently overran. An alternative would have been to have scrum-of-scrums every day but we never got around to trying that.

Our scrum-of-scrums agenda was:
Around the table, everyone describes what their team accomplished last week, what they plan to accomplish this week, and what impediments they have.
Any other cross-team concerns that need to be brought up, for example integration issues.
The agenda for scrum-of-scrums is not really important to me; the important thing is that you have regular scrum-of-scrums meetings.

> At Spotify, we usually do it in the form of “daily sync” between teams that are involved in something together. A short meeting, usually 15 minutes max. The agenda is focused on dependencies rather than status updates. One person from each team talks about what they need from other teams, if they are blocked on anything, and so on. We sometimes use a simple board with stickies to track unresolved cross-team dependencies. The meeting becomes like a small marketplace for identifying where there is a need for synchronization. The synchronization itself happens separately – the meeting just helps us figure out who needs to talk to whom to resolve the current dependency issues.

#### Corporate-level scrum-of-scrums
Lately, we’ve ditched the whole concept and replaced it with a weekly all-hands (well, all people involved in development) meeting instead. 15 minutes.

The meeting format is:
1. News and updates from the chief of development. Info about upcoming events, for example.
2. Round robin. One person from each product group reports on what they accomplished last week, what they plan to accomplish this week, and any problems. Some other people report as well (CM lead, QA lead, etc).
3. Anybody else is free to add any info or ask questions

This is a forum for brief information, not discussion or reflection. By leaving it at that, 15 minutes usually works. Sometimes we overrun, but very rarely to more than 30 minutes total. If interesting discussions pop up, I pause them and invite those who are interested to stay after the meeting and continue the discussion.

> As you see, the setup of scrum-of-scrums is very contextual. There’s definitely no one-size-fits-all. I sometimes get shocked by how companies can have the same mind-numbingly boring and ineffective meeting every week (or every day!), with glassy-eyed people staring at the floor, mumbling status updates as if reading off a script. Don’t be a Scrum zombie! Change something! Experiment! Constantly ask each other questions like “Is this meeting really adding value? Could it potentially add more value? What would we need to change to make it add more value?” Life is too short for boring meetings.

#### Interleaving the daily scrums
If you have many Scrum teams within a single product, and they all do the daily scrum at the same time, you have a problem. The product owner (and nosy people like me) can only attend one team’s daily scrum per day.
So we ask teams to avoid having daily scrums at the same time.
> The primary purpose of the daily scrum is for the team members to synchronize with each other. They should pick a time that works for them. Keeping nosy people like me in the loop – well, that’s secondary. So yes, it’s nice to have non-overlapping daily scrums. But don’t impose that on the teams.

#### Firefighting teams
We had a situation where a large product was unable to adopt Scrum because they spent too much time firefighting, i.e. panic-fixing bugs on their prematurely released system. This was a real vicious cycle, they were so busy firefighting that they didn’t have time to work proactively to prevent fires (i.e. improve the design, automating tests, create monitoring tools, alarm tools, etc.).

We addressed this problem by creating a designated firefighting team, and a designated Scrum team.
The Scrum team’s job was to (with the product owner’s blessing) try to stabilize the system and, effectively, prevent fires.

The firefighting team (we called them “support” actually) had two jobs:
- Fight fires
-  Protect the Scrum team from all kinds of disturbances, including things such as fending off ad hoc feature requests coming in from nowhere.

> This is a great pattern, but only as a temporary crisis-management strategy. Normally, you shouldn’t need a separate firefighting team. If you isolate the other teams from fires, they won’t learn to prevent new fires! Instead, if you have problem with bugs and fires coming in from time to time (which just about every company has), let each team figure out how to deal with that. Most teams end up having some kind of rotating firefighter role within the team. Simple and effective. And it gives them a clear incentive to write code that doesn’t catch fire!

#### Splitting the product backlog – or not?
Let’s say you have one product and two Scrum teams. How many product backlogs should you have? How many product owners? We’ve evaluated three models for this. The choice has a pretty big effect on how sprint planning meetings are carried out.
##### Strategy 1: One product owner, one backlog
This is the “There Can Only Be One” model. Our preferred model.

The good thing about this model is that you can let teams pretty much form themselves based on the product owner’s current top priorities. The product owner can focus on what he needs, and let the teams decide how to split the work up.
![One_PO_one_backlog.png](One_PO_one_backlog.png)

##### Strategy 2: One product owner, multiple backlogs
In this strategy, the product owner maintains multiple product backlogs, one per team. We haven’t actually tried this approach, but we’ve been close. This is basically our fallback plan in case the first approach fails.
The weakness of this strategy is that the product owner is allocating stories to teams, a task that teams probably are better at doing themselves.

![One_PO_multiple_backlogs.png](One_PO_multiple_backlogs.png)

> Typically, the product owner becomes a bottleneck in this case.

##### Strategy 3: Multiple product owners, one backlog per owner
This is like the second strategy, one product backlog per team, but with one product owner per team as well!
![Multiple_product_owners_one_backlog_per_owner.png](Multiple_product_owners_one_backlog_per_owner.png)
We haven’t done this, and we probably never will.
If the two product backlogs involve the same codebase, this will probably cause serious conflicts of interest between the two product owners.
If the two product backlogs involve separate codebases, this is essentially the same as splitting the whole product into separate sub-products and running them independently. This means we are back to the one-team- per-product situation, which is nice and easy.

> This is the model used at Spotify. Each of the 70+ teams has their own product owner and product backlog. Actually, in some cases we have a bit of Strategy 1 going on (one backlog shared by multiple teams), but for the most part each team has their own product owner and backlog. The upside is that we rarely need big planning meetings. The downside is that we have to put a lot of effort into decoupling the architecture to make this possible. Like with everything, there are always advantages and disadvantages. So just keep... uh.... (I was about to say “keep experimenting” but I’ve already said that so many times... I wouldn’t want to repeat myself, would I?)

#### Code branching
Be strict about keeping the mainline (or trunk) in a consistent state. This means, at the very least, that everything should compile and all unit tests should pass. It should be possible to create a working release at any given moment. Preferably the continuous-build system should build and auto- deploy to a test environment every night.
Tag each release. Whenever you release to acceptance test or to production, make sure there is a version tag on your mainline identifying exactly what was released. That means you can at any time in the future go back and create a maintenance branch from that point.
#### Multi-team retrospectives
So nowadays, in a multi- team scenario with dependencies, I prefer to do retrospective summaries as part of the actual retrospective. That is, each team goes off and does their own retro, and then after an hour or so we all meet again in a big room. Each team summarizes that key outcomes from their retro, and lists their most important unresolved impediment. After hearing each team, it usually becomes clear that impediment X is our biggest cross-team impediment (e.g. “inconsistent definition of done across teams” or “trunk keeps breaking”). That’s a perfect opportunity to do a mini-workshop around that, or find some volunteers (like one person from each team plus the manager) to go off and figure out a solution.
