#### Basic knowledge
 Here are the things which expect a front-end engineer (junior through senior) to know without any outside help:
 1. **DOM structure** – how nodes are related to one another and how to traverse from one to the next.
 2. **DOM manipulation** – how to add, remove, move, copy, create, and find nodes.
 3. **Events** -  how to use them and the major differences between IE and the DOM event models.
 4. **XMLHttpRequest** – what it is, how to perform a complete GET request, how to detect errors.
 5. **Strict vs. quirks modes** – how to trigger each and why this matters.
 6. **The box model** - how margin, padding, and border are related and the difference between border-box (standards mode) and content-box (old Internet Explorer) sizing.
 7. **Block vs. inline elements** – how to manipulate using CSS, how they effect things around them and your ability to style them.
 8. **Floating elements** – how to use them, troubles with them, and how to work around the troubles.
 9. **HTML vs. XHTML** – how they’re different, why you might want to use one over the other.
 10. **JSON** – what it is, why you’d want to use it, how to actually use it, implementation details.
#### Limited question

A sample question which involves multiple steps and allow for follow-on questions should I so choose: 
> I have a page that displays the current stock price for Yahoo!. This page has a button that you can click to refresh that price inline, without unloading the page. Please describe how you would implement this, assuming that the server always has the correct stock price data.

This question hits a good group of the basic knowledge that I want: DOM structure, DOM manipulation, event handling, DOM manipulation, XHR, and JSON. I could cover more of the points by asking for an alternative treatment of the stock price or some other message to be displayed on the page. For more senior candidates, I can easily continue on with other topics just as differences between JSON and XML, security issues, and capacity issues. And expect all answers to **not** involve using libraries. Library knowledge isn’t useful to me because libraries change over time.
#### Problem solving
The thing that makes front-end engineering so interesting is that there are multiple ways to solve the same problem, and it’s the context that determines the correct approach. When I ask questions, I tend to ask for a second way to do it after the candidate has explained one way. I ask them to imagine that for some reason their solution won’t work and ask for another. This accomplishes a couple of things. 

Want to see how they’ll solve a brand new problem using what they already know.
#### Enthusiasm
We haven’t been taught our skills in college or in seminars, so front-end engineers need to be self-taught. And since browser technology changes so rapidly, we also need to constantly be upgrading our skills to keep up. I can’t force someone to follow blogs and keep trying to learn more, that has to be something the candidate brings to the table.
People who are enthusiastic about web development are always reading, always trying to pick up new skills; these are the people I want to work with.

##### In the end
There are other skills that are useful, such as computer science or web design knowledge, but those are bonuses over the basic knowledge. If the basic knowledge is there, it’s easy to build on top of whereas it’s horrifically difficult to teach the basics from scratch while on the job.

And as I always tell people who are new to interviewing, there’s really only one question to ask yourself when you leave the room: do I want to work with this person? If the answer is no for any reason, then it’s a no.
