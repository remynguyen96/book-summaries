The topic of this lesson is clarity of communication. You will:
- consider planning questions
- practice structuring requests, points of view and information.
You will also plan and present several messages to others.
#### Key planning questions and common answers
The more you plan the more it becomes second nature to communicate clearly and coherently. When planning to communicate, consider the three planning questions:
1. Who is your audience?
2. What is your intent?
3. What are you audience's need and interests?

This will ensure your message is clear and relevant for your audience. Consider the following situations and match the audience, intent as well as audience's needs and interest.
#### Introduction of DEAR structure
The DEAR structure, developed by the creator of dialectical behaviour therapy, Dr Marsha Linham, connects feelings to needs making it easier for others to understand and act on your request. The sequence of the DEAR structure may vary depending on your relationship with the person you are asking or the nature of the request. What words do the letters in the acronym stand for?

**Describe**: the situation in a simple way. State only the facts, avoiding opinion and interpretation.
**Express:** How the situation makes you feel if appropriate.
**Assert:** your need clearly. Use either an indirect or direct style according to your audience. Include specific criteria and a timeframe.
**Reinforce:** why the other person should carry out your request. Provide the listener with a what’s in it for me.
#### Introduction of PREP structure
The PREP structure will be useful to present your point in a clear, meaningful and memorable when participating in discussions. What words do the letters in the acronym stand for?

1. What is your key message or **Point**? Say it in one or two sentences.  

2. What are the **Reasons**? Select one to three that are meaningful to your listener. Use facts, data or research to add credibility.  

3. What **Example**, testimony, or story best illustrates your point? Ensure your listener(s) can relate to what you say.  

4. Restate your key message or **Point** to make it memorable.

#### Introduction of Triangle structure
When you need to give information to others, organise what you have to say in three clear points. Information that is presented in threes is clear, coherent and memorable. Remember to select information that will resonate with your listeners’ needs and interests. Match the statements with the illustrations.

-----Point 2--------Point 3--------

 We have made some key changes to the existing point-based customer loyalty programme as a result of the feedback survey outcomes we discussed last month.  
Customers will now be awarded points for new customer referrals. We have updated the app so that customers can now access and redeem their points directly through their client area.  
And we have also expanded the range of products which customers can now redeem their points on.
