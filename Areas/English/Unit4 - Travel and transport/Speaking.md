#### What is your job?
I currently work as a software engineer at a large bank in Australia. I've been in the job for about 5 years. I'm usually assigned to work with a specific business to create new features in order to improve performance and user experience through various company strategies. I also have to consult and assist my team members in getting their job done. For instance, I have the responsibility to see whether the solutions are sensible and are following team conventions or principles.
#### Is there much to do in your current city?
Oh yes, there's certainly lots to do there as it's a fairly big city. If you like going out in the evening, there are a lot of good restaurants and bars. If you prefer cultural activities there are museums and art galleries. But if you like nature there are lots of other things outside the city which are easy to reach.

#### What are the people like in your hometown?
Well, they aren't any different from the people in any other large cities. For instance, here we also have good and bad people. Secondly, like everyone else, they are trying to work out a good life for themselves as well as their children. For example, parents are trying all they can to ensure that their children receive a good education.
