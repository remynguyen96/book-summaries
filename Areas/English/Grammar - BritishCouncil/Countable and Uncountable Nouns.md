##### Grammar Explanation:
**Nouns can be countable or uncountable.** 
- Countable nouns can be counted, e.g. _an apple_, _two apples_, _three apples_, etc. 
- Uncountable nouns cannot be counted, e.g. _air_, _rice_, _water_, etc. 
- When you learn a new noun, you should check if it is countable or uncountable and note how it is used in a sentence.
**Countable Nouns**
 - For positive sentences we can use **a/an** for **singular** nouns or **some** for **plurals**.
 - For negatives we can use **a/an** for singular nouns and **any** for plurals.
**Uncountable Nouns**
- Bread, rice, coffee, information, luggage, furniture, money, advice
- We use **some** with positive sentences and **any** with negatives.
**Questions**
In questions we use _a_/_an_, _any_ or _how many_ with countable nouns. And we use _any_ or _how much_ with uncountable nouns. But when we are offering something or asking for something, we normally use _some_. We also use _some_ in a question when we think the answer will be 'yes'
**Other expressions of quantity** : _A lot of_ (or _lots of_) can be used with both countable and uncountable nouns. Notice that we don't usually use _many_ or _much_ in positive sentences. We use _a lot of_ instead. However, in negative sentences we use _not many_ with countable nouns and _not much_ with uncountable nouns.

##### Grammar Explanation:
_A few_ and _a bit of_ or _a little_ mean _some_. Often we feel this amount is enough or more than we expected. We use _a few_ with plural nouns and _a bit of_ or _a little_ with uncountable nouns.
> _I have **a few** ideas.  
> I've brought **a few** friends.  
> There's **a bit of** milk left.  
> It needs **a little** more work._

We use _few_ and _very little_ to show that we are talking about a small amount. Often we feel this amount is not enough or less than we expected. _Few_ is for countable nouns and _very little_ is for uncountable nouns.
>_**Few** people came to the meeting.  
>There are **few** places where you can still see these birds.  
>We have **very little** time.  
>I have **very little** money._

Note that you can use _little_ without _very_, but it is less common and sounds quite formal.
