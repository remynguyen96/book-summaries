### Past continuous and past simple

- This time last year I **was studying** at university
- Sarah **hurt** her ankle while she **was running**.
- While I **was working** home, I **noticed** a new shop in the high street.
- At 6 PM yesterday it **was already getting** dark.
- I **saw** you driving down Green Street yesterday! Where **were** you **going**?
- When we **saw** the crime, we **called** the police.
##### Grammar explanation
The past continuous and the past simple help us to show how two past actions or situations are connected.
###### Past simple
The past simple shows us that an action was in the past, not in the present. Regular past simple verbs have -_ed_ at the end (e.g. _called_, _played_, _arrived_). Irregular verbs have a different form, usually with a different vowel sound (e.g. _wake_ → _woke_, _break_ → _broke_, _feel_ → _felt_).

> _My parents called me yesterday.  
> I woke up early this morning.  
> Sam played basketball when he was at university._

We make the negative with _didn't_ and the infinitive verb.

> _My parents didn't call me yesterday.  
> I didn't wake up early this morning._

We make the question form with _did_ and then the subject and infinitive verb.

> _Did you wake up early this morning?  
> Did Sam play basketball when he was at university?_
###### Past continuous
The past continuous shows us that the action was already in progress at a certain time in the past.

> _What were you doing at 8 p.m. last night? I was studying._

This means that I started studying before 8 p.m. and I continued after 8 p.m.
The past continuous can also show that an activity was in progress for some time, not just for a moment.

> _We were cleaning the house all morning._

We make the past continuous with _was_ or _were_ and the -_ing_ form of the verb.

> _She couldn't come to the party. She was working.  
> Three years ago, we were living in my home town.  
> I tried to give him some advice, but he wasn't listening.  
> What were you doing this time last year?_

###### Past continuous and past simple
When we use these two tenses together, it shows us that the past simple action happened in the middle of the past continuous action, while it was in progress.
> _While I was studying, I suddenly felt sleepy._

We often use these tenses to show an action interrupting another action.
>_I broke my leg when I was skiing.  
>As I was going to work, I saw an old friend.  
>We were watching television when the power went off._

Can you see a difference in the meaning of these two sentences?
>_When the guests arrived, Jane was cooking dinner._
>_When the guests arrived, Jane cooked dinner._

In the first one, Jane started cooking dinner before the guests arrived. We know that because it uses the past continuous. In the second sentence, the guests arrived first and then Jane started cooking.

### Verbs followed by "ing" or by "to" + infinitive 
A verb can be followed by another verb. The second one usually needs to change into the -_ing_ form or the _to_ + infinitive form. Which form you need depends on what the first verb is.

**Verbs followed by the -_ing_ form**: When _enjoy_, _admit_ and _mind_ are followed by another verb, it must be in the -_ing_ form.
> _I enjoy **traveling**.  
> He admitted **stealing** the necklace.  
> I don't mind **waiting** if you're busy._ 

Other verbs in this group include _avoid_, _can't help_, _consider_, _dislike_, _feel like_, _finish_, _give up_, _miss_, _practise_ and _suggest_.
_Like_ and _love_ can be followed by the -_ing_ form and the _to_ + infinitive form. They are both correct.

**Verbs followed by _to_ + infinitive form**: When _want_, _learn_ and _offer_ are followed by another verb, it must be in the _to_ + infinitive form.

>_I want **to speak** to the manager.  
>She's learning **to play** the piano.  
>He offered **to help** us wash up._

Other verbs in this group include _afford_, _agree_, _ask_, _choose_, _decide_, _expect_, _hope_, _plan_, _prepare_, _promise_, _refuse_ and _would like_.
