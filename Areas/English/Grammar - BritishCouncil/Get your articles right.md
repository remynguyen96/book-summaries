#### Jobs
When we say what people's jobs are, we usually use _a_/_an_.
#### Singular nouns
Singular, countable nouns always have an article – _a_/_an_ or _the_ (or another determiner – _my_, _your_, _this_, _that_, etc.).

We use _a_/_an_ – the indefinite article – when we talk about something for the first time, or something that is part of a group or type.
> _I saw **a** good film yesterday.  
> Do you want **a** drink?_

We use _a_ when the word that follows it begins with a consonant sound. We use _an_ when it's followed by a vowel sound. This makes pronunciation easier.
>_She has **a** university degree.  
>It took me **an** hour to get home._

We use _the_ – the definite article – when the listener already knows which thing we are talking about because it was mentioned before or because there's only one of them.

> _I'm going to take **the** dogs for a walk.  
> Have you seen **the** ciar key?  
> They go to **the** school next to **the** bridge._
#### Things in general
When we talk about things in general, we normally use a plural or uncountable noun with no article.
>_Birds eat worms.  
>Water freezes at 0°C.  
>Children need a lot of sleep._
