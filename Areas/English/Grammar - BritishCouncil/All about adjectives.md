Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.

However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them first. Remember that a preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (_-ing_ form).

With **at**: We use _at_ with adjectives like _good_/_bad_/_amazing_/_brilliant_/_terrible_, etc. to talk about skills and abilities.

With **about**: We often use _about_ with adjectives of feelings like _angry_/_excited_/_happy_/_nervous_/_sad_/_stressed_/_worried_, etc. to explain what is causing that feeling.

With **of**: However, sometimes we use _of_ with feelings. 

With **to**: We can use _to_ to show the connection between people or things. Or We can also use _to_ to talk about someone's behaviour towards someone else.

### Adjectives ending in '-ed' and '-ing'
Adjectives that end in _-ed_ (e.g. _bored_, _interested_) and adjectives that end in _-ing_ (e.g. _boring_, _interesting_) are often confused.

Adjectives that end in _-ed_ generally describe emotions – they tell us how people feel.

Adjectives that end in _-ing_ generally describe the thing that causes the emotion – a boring lesson makes you feel bored.

Here are some adjectives that can have both an _-ed_ and an _-ing_ form.

|                |                 |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| annoyed        | annoying        |
| _bored_        | _boring_        |
| _confused_     | _confusing_     |
| _disappointed_ | _disappointing_ |
| _excited_      | _exciting_      |
| _frightened_   | _frightening_   |
| _interested_   | _interesting_   |
| _surprised_    | _surprising_    |
