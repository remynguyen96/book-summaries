### Key Takeaways

Every sentence must have a **verb** to describe the action of the subject

There are two kinds of verbs: **action verbs** and **linking verbs.**
- **Action Verbs**: usually easy to identify, especially when the action is a familiar one, such as _swim, talk, buy, chew, study,_ or _explode._
- **Linking Verbs**: used most frequently is some form of the verb _be (am, is are, was, were)_. Some other linking verbs are _seem, grow, look, sound, taste,_ and _appear._

Most verbs are regular verbs. Verbs that do not add **-d** or **-ed** to form the past tense are called **irregular verbs**.

**Principal Forms of Verbs:**
 - The **present or base form** is the verb without any changes in spelling. It is used with plural nouns
- The **present +s form** is spelled by adding an **-s** or **-es** to the base form. It is used with singular nouns
- The **past form** is spelled by adding **-d** or **-ed** to a regular verb. Irregular verbs change the base form spelling in different ways
- The **past participle** is spelled the same as the past form in regular verbs. Irregular verbs that change the spelling should be memorized. The past participle is used with a form of the auxiliary verb _have._
- The **present participle** is spelled by adding **-ing** to the base form of the verb. It is used with a form of the auxiliary verb _be._

An **auxiliary verb** is often added to the main verb to form the verb in a sentence. The present participle and the past participle forms are _not_ used alone as the verb in a sentence. They are preceded by an auxiliary verb.

- A sentence must always have a main verb, but it may or may not have an auxiliary verb.
- If the sentence has an auxiliary verb, it is always placed in front of the main verb.
- In a question, the subject separates the auxiliary verb and the main verb.
- Present and past participles must be accompanied by an auxiliary verb.
- Present and past participles cannot function alone as the verbs of a sentence.
- _Be, have,_ and _do_ sometimes function as auxiliary verbs.

#### Adverbs
An **adverb** is a modifier that adds further information about verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. The following adverbs, in addition to others, frequently appear between auxiliary verbs and main verbs.
`Television will **never completely** replace the radio.`

The **future tense** is used for sentences about something that will happen in the future. The future tense is formed by using the auxiliary verbs will or would and the base form of the main verb

In the lesson on auxiliary verbs, you used the perfect tenses in some of the verbs that you identified or wrote. The name **perfect tenses** gives no clue to the uses of these tenses. Study the following examples to learn how to use the perfect tenses.

The **past perfect tense** is formed by using the auxiliary verb **had** plus the past participle of the main verb.

##### Tense Shift Problems
Do _not_ shift tenses in the middle of a sentence, a paragraph, or an essay unless you have a reason to do so. If you begin writing in the present tense, don’t shift to the past. If you begin in the past, don’t shift to the present.

E.g. All the verbs are in the past tense.
`Kite flying was a good way to meet people. They were curious when they saw my kite up there. They wondered why I wasted my time with a kite.`

###### 2.16- Some of the following sentences contain shifts in tense. Identify each error by drawing a line under the incorrect verb

1. Last Tuesday night I went to the library because I had a test in history on Wednesday morning. It ~~is~~ **was** too noisy at home to study. My brother ~~is~~ **was** playing the stereo, my mother was vacuuming, and my little sister and her friend ~~are~~ **were** chasing each other around the house. How ~~am~~ **was** I supposed to concentrate with all that commotion?

2. My friend Greg loves peanut butter. Every morning he **spreads** peanut butter on his toast or waffles. He **snacks** on peanut butter cups at school, and, of course, he ~~ate~~ eats peanut butter sandwiches for lunch every day. Nowadays he bakes his own peanut butter cookies because his mother ~~had refused~~ **has refused** to make them anymore. Greg ~~was~~ **is** a hopeless case; he even covers a slice of chocolate cake with peanut butter.

3. My wife and I bought a golden retriever puppy last year. We made the mistake on the first few nights of allowing the puppy to sleep on a rug by our bed because he ~~misses~~ **missed** his brothers and sisters. Later when we made a bed for him in the laundry room, he ~~howls~~ howled and ~~scratches~~ **scratched** on the door for several hours every night. After a while the neighbors ~~call~~ **called** on the telephone to complain about the noise. We thought that he ~~will~~ would never give up. The puppy finally learned to sleep by himself, and the neighbors ~~start~~ **started** speaking to us again.
