## Key Takeaways

Readers usually ask more of the writer—more color, more variety, more information—in short, more specific details. Adjectives added to nouns, and adverbs added to verbs give the reader additional information by further describing and qualifying the nouns and verbs.

An **adjective** makes a noun or pronoun specific or concrete by limiting and describing it.

The possessive form of the pronoun is called an adjective because it describes and qualifies nouns: his book, my book. The possessive form of a noun is also called an adjective. Your reader knows exactly what house you are talking about when you write Gene’s house or the Martins’ house. The possessive nouns are modifying the noun “house” and are, therefore, adjectives.

**Special Forms of Adjectives**:  
	Sometimes present and past participles are used as adjectives
	`defeated team`

Use commas to separate two or more adjectives that modify the same noun if they are not linked by a coordinating connective such as and or but.
`The irritated candidate spoke in a loud, indignant voice.`

Adjectives have three forms: positive (base form), comparative, and superlative. Most adjectives change their form for use in comparisons. For example, **soft, softer, softest** show differences in degree.

Another kind of modifier is an adverb. Adverbs add further information about verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. Study the following tests for an adverb.
Adverbs are usually added to a basic sentence to give the reader more information.
The position of an adverb in a sentence is flexible; that is, it can be moved around in a sentence
Adverbs, like adjectives, have degrees of comparison: the positive, the comparative, the superlative.
` I had thought that Jan skated more gracefully than Marie. But then I saw Adele skate after the other two girls. Adele skated most gracefully of all.`

**Verbal phrases** can be indispensable additions to a basic sentence because they greatly increase the possibilities for expanding it.
**Verbals** are formed from verbs and introduce verbal phrases. They usually include a noun and/or a prepositional phrase. They are used as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs in sentences.
```
- to choose a pet
- chosen for its intelligent
- choosing a Seeing Eye dog
```
- TO + A VERB = A VERBAL PHRASE
- TO + A NOUN AND AND IT'S MODIFIERS = A PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE

**Punctuation**: At the beginning of a sentence, use a comma after an introductory verbal phrase.
`Standing at the end of the line, I had little hope of getting a ticket.`

**Misplaced Modifiers**: Misplaced modifiers are exactly what the term suggests. These modifiers are called misplaced because they have been incorrectly placed next to words that they are not intended to modify.
E.g. I heard that our nation needs additional engineers on the television news. (misplaced modifier)
> The engineers are not needed on the television news, are they? You should place on the television news after the verb _heard._
> 
> I heard on the television news that our nation needs additional engineers. (correctly placed modifier)

**Dangling Modifiers**: A word or a phrase is called a dangling modifier when there is no word in the sentence for it to modify.

E.g.  `Showing an interest in computers, personnel offices are flooded with applications.`
> Were the personnel offices showing an interest in computers? Of course not. The verbal phrase modifier, Showing an interest in computers, is left dangling. There is no word in the sentence for it to modify. To correct this problem, write the sentence as follows:
> Showing an interest in computers, students are flooding personnel offices with applications.

Another method of eliminating dangling modifiers changes the dangling word or phrase into a subordinate clause. You could correct the example given above as follows:
> Because students are showing an interest in computers, personnel offices are flooded with applications.

You cannot get rid of a dangling modifier by moving it around in a sentence. Since there is no word in the sentence for it to modify, you must rewrite the sentence and add the word that the phrase modifies.

###### 4.12- Rewrite this paragraph on the lines provided. Correct the dangling modifiers in each sentence.

Expecting a robot like R2D2, the robot that was demonstrated to Willy was disappointing. Propelling itself on large wheels, Willy had hoped for useful arms and legs. Having limited mobility, stairs could not be climbed. Responding to voice command, a distance of less than seventy feet was necessary between the robot and its owner. Frustrated by the poor quality, his decision to buy a robot would have to be delayed.

=> Expecting a robot like R2D2, Willy was disappointed by the robot that was demonstrated to him. 

Willy had hoped the robot would have useful for arms and legs, but it propelled itself on large wheel.

Having limited mobility, the robot could not climb stairs.

A distance of less than seventy feet was necessary between the robot and its owner for the robot to be able to response to voice command.

Frustrated by the poor quality, Willy decided to delay his decision to buy a robot.
